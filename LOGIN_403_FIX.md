# Login Build Errors Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 403 Error - Azure/DALL-E Blob URL
The login page was showing a 403 error for an Azure/DALL-E blob URL:
```
oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/... (403 - Server failed to authenticate)
```

**Root Cause:** Expired temporary URLs from Azure blob storage that were previously cached in the browser or referenced in scripts.

### 2. Build Error - Duplicate Route Paths
```
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. 
Please check /(public)/login and /login.
```

**Root Cause:** Duplicate page files existed at both `app/login/page.tsx` and `app/(public)/login/page.tsx`, causing Next.js routing conflicts. Same issue for signup pages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Manifest Cleanup** (`public/manifest.json`)
- Created a clean manifest file with no external icon references
- Only uses local resources

### 2. **Layout Cache Control** (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added explicit cache control headers to prevent browser caching issues
- Added proper favicon and manifest references
- Ensures no stale external resources are loaded

### 3. **Content Security Policy** (`next.config.ts`)
- Implemented CSP headers to block external blob URLs
- Only allows images from local sources (`'self'` and `data:`)
- Whitelist for necessary external APIs (Supabase, ElevenLabs)
- Blocks any Azure blob storage URLs

### 4. **Image Configuration**
- Disabled remote image patterns
- All coach images are now served from `/public/images/coaches/`
- All feature images from `/public/images/features/`

## How to Test

1. **Clear browser cache completely**:
   ```
   Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete → Clear all cached images and files
   ```

2. **Hard reload**:
   ```
   Cmd+Shift+R (or Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
   ```

3. **Restart development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access login page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/login
   ```

## Expected Result
- ✅ No 403 errors in console
- ✅ Login page loads cleanly
- ✅ All images load from local `/public/images/` directory
- ✅ No external Azure blob URLs attempted

## Files Changed
- `public/manifest.json` - Clean manifest with no external resources
- `app/layout.tsx` - Cache control + CSP setup + proper meta tags
- `next.config.ts` - Content Security Policy headers + image restrictions
- **DELETED** `app/login/` - Removed duplicate login directory
- **DELETED** `app/signup/` - Removed duplicate signup directory
- **KEPT** `app/(public)/login/` - Public route group with proper layout
- **KEPT** `app/(public)/signup/` - Public route group with proper layout

## Notes
- All coach images already exist in `/public/images/coaches/`
- The DALL-E URLs in `scripts/download-and-save-images.js` are only for reference and not used in production
- CSP will prevent any future attempts to load external blob storage URLs
