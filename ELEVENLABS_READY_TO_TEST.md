# ✅ ElevenLabs Voice Call - Ready to Test!

## Status: FIXED AND READY 🎉

The ElevenLabs integration has been completely fixed and is now ready for testing across all platforms.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue
**404 Error**: `POST /v1/convai/conversation` endpoint didn't exist

### Solution
- ✅ Removed incorrect POST request
- ✅ Implemented direct WebSocket connection
- ✅ Added cross-platform audio support (iOS, Android, Web)
- ✅ Proper PCM16 audio format
- ✅ iOS AudioContext handling
- ✅ Continuous real-time streaming

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd /Users/marlow/Documents/Cursor-projects/icf-coach
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Voice Session
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/voice-session`

### 3. Grant Microphone Permission
When browser prompts for microphone access, click **Allow**

### 4. Check Console Output
You should see:
```
✅ Agent initialized
🌍 Platform: { isIOS: false, isAndroid: false, isMobile: false, isWeb: true }
✅ Conversation ID: session_1730304000000_abc123xyz
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket: wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=agent_8401k8tmvpwpfak9f6c3x6g4zgzv
✅ Connected to ElevenLabs agent via WebSocket
✅ Conversation initialized
🎤 Starting microphone recording...
✅ Recording started successfully
🎤 Microphone active - continuous streaming
✅ Voice session fully active
```

### 5. Speak Into Microphone
Say something like: "Hello, I want to talk about my goals"

### 6. Wait for Response
You should see:
```
📨 Transcript: Hello, I want to talk about my goals
🔊 Received audio data: ...
```

And hear the AI coach respond with voice!

### Audio Specifications
- **Format**: PCM16 (16-bit signed integers)
- **Sample Rate**: 16,000 Hz
- **Channels**: Mono (1 channel)
- **Buffer Size**: 2048 samples (~128ms chunks)
- **Encoding**: Base64 in JSON WebSocket messages

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Audio Output
1. Check device volume
2. Check browser audio permissions
3. Look for audio errors in console
4. On iOS, ensure user interaction happened

### Microphone Not Working
1. Check browser permissions
2. Ensure HTTPS (localhost is OK for dev)
3. Try different browser
4. Check console for specific error

### WebSocket Fails
1. Verify API key in .env.local
2. Check agent ID is correct
3. Check network connectivity
4. Look for CORS or firewall issues

### High Latency
1. Check network speed
2. Verify buffer size (2048 is optimal)
3. Check CPU usage
4. Try different network
