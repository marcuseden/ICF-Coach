```

```bash
node scripts/delete-user.js m_lowegren@example.com
```

1. ✅ Found user in auth.users
2. ✅ Deleted profile from profiles table
3. ✅ Deleted client record (if existed)
4. ✅ Deleted user from auth.users
5. ✅ Verified deletion successful

### 4. Verified Correct User
```bash
node scripts/test-login.js
```

---

## Login Credentials (FINAL)

Use these credentials to login:

```
URL: http://localhost:3000/login
Email: m_lowegren@mac.com
Password: coach2024
```

**Do NOT use:** `m_lowegren@example.com` (this has been deleted)

---

## How This Happened

The wrong email was likely created when running:
```bash
node scripts/add-or-reset-user.js
```

Without providing the email argument, it defaulted to:
```javascript
const email = process.argv[2] || 'm_lowegren@example.com';  // Default fallback
```

---

## Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/delete-user.js`
Safely deletes a user from Supabase:
```bash
# Delete specific user
node scripts/delete-user.js email@example.com

# Delete with default email
node scripts/delete-user.js
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds user in auth.users
2. Deletes from profiles table
3. Deletes from clients table
4. Deletes from auth.users
5. Verifies deletion

### 2. `scripts/test-login.js`
Tests if a user can login:
```bash
node scripts/test-login.js
```

**What it checks:**
1. User exists in auth.users
2. Profile exists in profiles
3. Login credentials work
4. Session is created
5. Client record (if applicable)

---

## Prevention

To prevent creating users with wrong emails in the future:

### Always Specify Email Explicitly
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Specify email
node scripts/add-or-reset-user.js m_lowegren@mac.com coach2024 admin

# ❌ WRONG - Uses default fallback
node scripts/add-or-reset-user.js
```

### Update Script Default
Consider updating the default in `add-or-reset-user.js`:
```javascript
// Change from:
const email = process.argv[2] || 'm_lowegren@example.com';

// To:
const email = process.argv[2];
if (!email) {
  console.error('❌ Email is required!');
  console.log('Usage: node add-or-reset-user.js EMAIL PASSWORD ROLE [NAME]');
  process.exit(1);
}
```

## Database Clean State
